# On Tides of Uncertainty 🌊⚛️

*On Tides of Uncertainty* is my personal quantum playground — an evolving space documenting my learning journey, built quantum functions, algorithm implementations, experiments, and more. It blends curiosity-driven research with hands-on development, capturing the beautiful chaos of qubits, superpositions, and algorithms.

In the future, it might evolve into the foundation for a more interactive platform — one that brings the delightful nonsensicality of qubits to a broader audience. After all, everyone should experience the existential absurdity of the quantum world.

Feel free to explore or reverse-engineer anything here — and don’t hesitate to reach out if you have questions or ideas.

## 📁 Structure

- `qutilities/`: Low-level reusable components (e.g. controlled gates, register helpers)
- `algorithms/`: Full algorithm implementations (Shor, Grover, etc.)
- `notebooks/`: Educational experiments, proofs-of-concept, and dynamic demos
- `~legacy/`: Earlier code from the beginning of this quantum journey

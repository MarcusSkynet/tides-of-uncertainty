# On Tides of Uncertainty 🌊⚛️

*On Tides of Uncertainty* is my personal quantum playground — an evolving space documenting my learning journey, built quantum functions, algorithm implementations, experiments, and more. It blends curiosity-driven research with hands-on development, capturing the beautiful chaos of qubits, superpositions, and algorithms.

In the future, it might evolve into the foundation for a more interactive platform — one that brings the delightful nonsensicality of qubits to a broader audience. After all, everyone should experience the existential absurdity of the quantum world.

Feel free to explore or reverse-engineer anything here — and don’t hesitate to reach out if you have questions or ideas.

## 🧩 Project Structure

This repository contains both installable code and supporting research materials:

- [`qutilities/`](https://github.com/MarcusSkynet/qutilities) → Modular and reusable quantum tools  
  Includes: QFT, QPE, circuit gates, approximation layers, debug logic.

- `algorithms/` → Educational demos like Deutsch-Jozsa, QPE examples, modular arithmetic
- `notebooks/` → Walkthroughs, circuit construction lessons, testing notebooks
- `~legacy/`: Earlier chaotic version from the beginning of my quantum journey

## 📦 Installation

To use the modular components (QFT, QPE, etc.), install the  
👉 [qutilities package](https://github.com/MarcusSkynet/qutilities):

```bash
pip install -e .
```

> Full usage, API, and changelog live in the [qutilities README](https://github.com/MarcusSkynet/qutilities#readme).

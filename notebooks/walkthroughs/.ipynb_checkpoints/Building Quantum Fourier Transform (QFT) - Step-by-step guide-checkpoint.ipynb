    "The **Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT)** is one of the foundational algorithms in quantum computing. It plays a role analogous to the classical **Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT)** in signal processing—but on quantum states rather than on classical data arrays. Because of its ability to transform the computational basis states into equally spaced phase relationships, QFT underpins several of the most significant quantum algorithms known today, including **Shor’s algorithm** for factoring and **phase estimation** algorithms used in quantum chemistry and other applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "In simpler terms, the QFT translates the amplitudes of quantum basis states into a phase representation that can be exponentially more compact and powerful for certain tasks. This is especially apparent in algorithms that leverage interference patterns in the phase of quantum states to extract hidden eigenvalues or periodicities. Classic examples include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Shor’s factoring algorithm**: Where the QFT is used to find the period of a function, thus providing the key step to factor large integers efficiently.\n",
    "- **Quantum phase estimation**: Crucial for algorithms that attempt to measure eigenvalues of unitary operators, allowing processes such as the estimation of ground-state energies in molecules (useful in quantum chemistry).\n",
    "\n",
    "Below, we move step by step through building a QFT in Qiskit. Along the way, we discuss each operation in detail—Hadamard gates, controlled phase gates, the significance of reversing qubits, and optional steps like debugging visualization, returning the circuit as a named gate, and implementing the inverse QFT."

    "Here, we start with the absolute skeleton of the QFT algorithm. A function named `qft` takes a single argument `num_qubits`, which represents the number of qubits on which the QFT will operate. Initially, this function does nothing—`pass` is simply a Python placeholder.\n",
    "\n",
    "The reason we define a separate function is to make the QFT modular, reusable, and easy to integrate into larger circuits or to swap out for an inverse QFT if needed. In quantum programming, it’s often beneficial to structure circuits as subroutines (like building blocks or gates) that we can repeatedly insert into more complex algorithms. This approach also allows you to specify parameters (for example, number of qubits, whether to do final swaps, etc.) that can be toggled as needed.\n",

Because the QFT is conventionally constructed from the most significant qubit (MSQ) to the least significant qubit (LSQ). If you label your qubits from $0$ to $n-1$, the most significant qubit might be qubit $n-1$. This convention arises from how we encode quantum states in the computational basis.\n",

Sticking to a consistent pattern—like reversed iteration—helps align with the canonical mathematical definitions of the QFT."

    "Mathematically, the inverse QFT is the Hermitian adjoint ($\\dagger$) of the QFT. For a classical Fourier transform, the inverse differs by using a complex conjugate exponent and a normalization factor. In quantum computing, normalization factors are often embedded within the definitions of the gates (like the Hadamard’s built-in $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}$), so you only need to worry about changing the sign of the exponent to get the inverse.\n",

In Shor’s algorithm, for example, you feed a superposition into a series of controlled operations, and just before measuring, you apply the inverse QFT to decode the phases into a classical register that reveals the periodicity of a function."

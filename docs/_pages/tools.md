### Project 1: A Quantum Circuit Model of the Ledger

This project provides a hands-on guide to the microscopic foundation of the DCT-QG ledger, implemented in Qiskit. The notebook demonstrates how to construct a functional ledger node using the principles of holographic error correction and how to simulate its interaction with quantum states.

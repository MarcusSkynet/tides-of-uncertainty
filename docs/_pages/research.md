<h2 class="archive__subtitle">A Unified Framework for Quantum Gravity and Cosmology</h2>

I am an independent researcher developing a new, falsifiable framework for quantum gravity called Dimensional Collapse Theory (DCT-QG). It is a first-principles theory built on a single, foundational premise: **that spacetime dimensionality is a local, dynamic quantity.**

This framework uses the established principles of General Relativity, Quantum Mechanics, and Thermodynamics to derive solutions to some of the biggest puzzles in physics, including:

*   A physical, non-singular model for black holes that resolves the information paradox.
*   A unified origin for Dark Matter and Dark Energy as natural consequences of the theory.
*   A set of concrete, falsifiable predictions, most notably a distinct signature of gravitational wave echoes.

This page serves as the central hub for the formal papers that outline this research.

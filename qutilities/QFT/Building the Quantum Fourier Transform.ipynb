    "\n",
    "### Task:\n",
    "We begin by defining a function to create a QFT circuit. The function should take three parameters:\n",
    "1. `qft_qubits`: The number of qubits.\n",
    "2. `inverse`: A flag to determine whether to build the inverse QFT.\n",
    "3. `include_swaps`: A flag to determine whether to apply SWAP gates at the end.\n",

    "### Code:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from qiskit import QuantumCircuit, QuantumRegister\n",

    "        qft_qubits (int): The number of qubits for the QFT circuit.\n",
    "        inverse (bool): If True, creates the inverse QFT circuit. Defaults to False.\n",
    "        include_swaps (bool): If True, includes SWAP gates at the end to reverse qubit order. Defaults to True.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Returns:\n",
    "        Gate: A gate representing the QFT or inverse QFT with appropriate labeling.\n",

    "## Step 2: Applying Hadamard and Controlled Phase Rotations\n",
    "\n",
    "### Task:\n",
    "For each qubit, we:\n",
    "1. Apply a Hadamard gate.\n",
    "2. Apply controlled phase rotations with decreasing phase angles.\n",

    "## Step 3: Reordering Qubits with SWAP Gates\n",
    "\n",
    "### Task:\n",
    "At the end of the QFT, the qubit order is reversed. If `include_swaps` is `True`, we apply SWAP gates to restore the original order.\n",

    "            qft_circuit.swap(i, qft_qubits - i - 1)\n",

    "    return qft_circuit.to_gate(label=label)\n",
    "```\n",

    "### Explanation:\n",
    "- The circuit is converted into a gate using `.to_gate(label=label)`.\n",
